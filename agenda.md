# Background
## Create a web app to explore XKCD strips

- Use the API described at https://xkcd.com/json.html
- It should be able to show thumbnails for all strips (but not necessarily show all at exactly the same time)
- You should be able to explore each strip more closely in some way
- Use reusable components
- Build your software in such a way that you and your colleagues can build on it and maintain it for a long time to come
- Deploy this some place of your choice or describe how you would do so
